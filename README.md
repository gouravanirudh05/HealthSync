<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Project](frontend/src/assets/image.png)

This healthcare platform is a modern, scalable web application designed to provide users with an engaging and personalized healthcare management experience. The platform is built using a full-stack architecture with the latest technologies to ensure a responsive, high-performance user interface and robust backend functionality.

At its core, the platform combines React.js for dynamic frontend development, Node.js and Express.js for building fast, scalable server-side APIs, and MongoDB for a flexible and efficient database solution. It also leverages th OpenStreetMap API for geolocation-based features, enhancing user accessibility and convenience.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Landing Page**:Displays a map of nearby hospitals using device location, powered by OpenStreetMap API.
- **Dynamic Blogs**: Health blogs are generated dynamically to provide up-to-date and relevant health information.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Users can interact with a chatbot to discuss health-related issues.

- **User Dashboards**:
    * **Patient Dashboard**: View appointments, profiles, and reports.
    * **Doctor Dashboard**: Manage appointments and patient records. 
    * **Admin Dashboard**: Oversee platform operations and user managemen
- **Secure Login and Registration**: Separate registration for patients and doctors.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Users can schedule appointments seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Leveraging **MongoDB** for real-time updates on patients reports and patient-doctor interactions.
- **Agora-Powered Private Video Consultations**: Secure video consultations using Agora with unique meeting IDs.

### Agora Integration for Secure Video Consultations:

A major challenge we faced was that Agora uses a common meeting name, allowing anyone with the name to join. To ensure privacy, we implemented a unique meeting name by combining the unique IDs of the patient and doctor. This way, each meeting is private, preventing unauthorized access
### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: Dynamic and responsive user interface.
  - **TailWinD CSS**: simplifies styling and custom designs, making the interface visually appealing and easy to maintain.
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that powers the backend, enabling asynchronous, non-blocking I/O for high scalability.
  - **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing robust tools for creating RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests efficiently.
  
- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows for flexible, schema-less data storage, ideal for storing user profiles, progress data, and course content.
- **API**:  
    * **OpenStreetMap API**: Used to display nearby hospitals based on user location, utilizing device geolocation.  
    * **Gemini API**: Powers the chatbot functionality, providing intelligent responses to user health-related queries.  
    * **NewsAPI**: Fetches the latest health-related news articles dynamically for the blog section.  
    * **MongoDB Atlas API**: Serves as the backend database for storing user data, appointments, and reports securely.  
    * **Browser Geolocation API**: Retrieves the user's current location to enable personalized map views and proximity-based hospital listings.  
    * **Custom REST APIs**: Built with Node.js and Express.js for managing user authentication, profile management, appointment scheduling, and report generation.  


### Workflow & Interaction:

1. **Sign-In/Sign-Up**: Users can sign up and log in via secure authentication. Once logged in, their data, including appointments, profiles, and health records, is securely persisted across sessions.

2. **Dynamic Map on Landing Page**: Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dynamic map powered by the OpenStreetMap API, which displays nearby hospitals and healthcare facilities based on their device's location.

3. **Dynamic Health Blogs**: Users can access dynamically generated health blogs that provide insights into various medical topics and health tips. The content is updated regularly to keep users informed.

4. **Integrated Chatbot Assistance**: The platform includes a chatbot designed to assist users with health-related queries in real time, offering a personalized and interactive experience.

5. **User Role-Based Dashboards**:

    * Patients:

      * Schedule and manage appointments easily through a user-friendly interface.

      * View and download health reports directly from their dashboard.

      * Update and maintain their personal profile details.

    * Doctors:

      * Manage and track appointments efficiently.

      * Access and review patient details and reports.

      * Communicate with patients via integrated tools.

    * Admins:

      * Oversee platform operations, including user and content management.

      * Monitor overall activity and ensure smooth functioning of the system.

      * Schedule Appointments: The platform offers a seamless appointment scheduling system where users can book appointments with doctors based on availability.

6. **Real-Time Data Updates**: All changes made by users (appointments, reports, or profile updates) are instantly synchronized with the backend to provide a consistent and updated user experience.

7. **Secure Video Consultations with Agora**: Patients and doctors can connect privately with unique meeting IDs.

This platform combines a powerful backend with an interactive front-end to create a scalable, robust, and user-friendly healthcare solution. It has been designed to support the growing needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and administrators, ensuring a seamless experience for all.
